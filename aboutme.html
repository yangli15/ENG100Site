	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/WebsitePic.jpg" width="250" height="300" class="floatright" />
	<p>My name is Yang Li, and I am currently studying Computer Science as my major here at UIUC. </p>
	
	<p>I was born and raised in Qingdao, China until two months before my tenth birthday, and then I came to the United States and lived in Irvine, California for eight more years. </p>
	
	<p>	Besides desperately trying to excel in all of my classes (which I did not…) and thinking of my future, I also have my own interests, some of which are: video games, music, reading fantasy novels and manga.</p>
